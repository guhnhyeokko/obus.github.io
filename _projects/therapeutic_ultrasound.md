## Research Fields

### Basic Research on Brain Tissue and Cerebral Blood Flow Interaction

We investigate the fundamental interactions between brain tissue and cerebral blood flow, exploring how ultrasound can modulate these relationships for therapeutic benefit.

### 40Hz Gamma Band Stimulation and Cerebral Blood Flow Monitoring

Our research explores the effects of 40Hz gamma band auditory and visual stimulation combined with focused ultrasound stimulation on the brain. We continuously monitor cerebral blood flow changes to understand the therapeutic mechanisms.

### Shock Wave Brain Stimulation Using CNT Transducers

We develop and investigate novel shock wave brain stimulation techniques utilizing carbon nanotube (CNT) transducers, pushing the boundaries of non-invasive neuromodulation.

### Brain Stimulation Research with Disease Models

Using Parkinson's and Alzheimer's disease transgenic mouse models, we conduct comprehensive brain stimulation research to develop targeted therapeutic interventions for neurodegenerative conditions.
