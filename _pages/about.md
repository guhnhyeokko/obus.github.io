Our research group focuses on **underwater acoustics**, **diagnosis**, and **therapeutic ultrasound** based on various characteristics of **ultrasound technology**. In **underwater environments** where light usage is limited, we study underwater communication, seabed exploration through sonar, and plankton detection using ultrasonic scattering characteristics. In the field of **diagnostic ultrasound**, we conduct research on cardiovascular diseases such as arteriosclerosis through both in vitro and in vivo experiments, as well as numerical simulations of **red blood cell aggregation**. For **therapeutic applications**, we perform fundamental research on brain lesion treatment using High Intensity Focused Ultrasound (HIFU) technology. By leveraging the diverse properties of ultrasound, our work spans both underwater acoustics and medical applications.
